The Spring Empowerment Conference, started in 2010, seeks to provide resources for and promote discussion of issues relevant to the life choices of graduate women. The planning committee comprises women from across MIT departments and invites speakers that are role models for graduate women and/or experts on how to become those role models. Events have included a lecture on implicit bias, a panel on collaboration, a workshop on online personal branding, a panel of "power couples," and a panel on modern feminism.
