The Fall Leadership Conference, started in 2010, seeks to provide graduate women with the opportunity to gain communication and leadership skills. The organizing committee comprises women from across MIT departments and has invited top experts to share advice. Events have included negotiation workshops, a workshop on assertive communication, and a (professional) wardrobe workshop from a clothing boutique owner.
